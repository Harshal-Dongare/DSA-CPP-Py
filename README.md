# DSA-CPP-Py

Welcome to **DSA-CPP-Py**! This repository contains my solutions for a variety of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems, implemented in both **C++** and **Python**. It's a collection of coding challenges, algorithmic problems, and solutions across different difficulty levels, from beginner to advanced.

## üìö Contents

-   **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hashmaps, etc.
-   **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Divide and Conquer, etc.
-   **Problem-Solving Skills**: Each solution comes with comments and explanations to help you understand the thought process behind it.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies

-   **C++**: Leveraging the power of C++ for optimal performance and low-level memory management.
-   **Python**: Using Python for its simplicity, readability, and rich library support.

## üöÄ Features

-   **Dual Language Solutions**: For every problem, I have provided solutions in both C++ and Python to help compare and contrast the implementation differences between these languages.
-   **Clear Explanations**: Each algorithm comes with detailed comments explaining the approach, logic, and time complexity analysis.
-   **Problem Categorization**: Problems are organized based on difficulty levels (Easy, Medium, Hard), so you can start with the basics and gradually move on to more complex topics.
